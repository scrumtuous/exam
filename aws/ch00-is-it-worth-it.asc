== Chapter 0: Is AWS Practitioner Certification Worth It?

If you’re reading this, you’ve decided to pursue the AWS Practitioner certification. That’s a good decision.

The AWS Practitioner designation is the one certification I want on every job applicant that I interview.

Full stack developer? Project Manager? Product Owner? SysAdmin? Scrum Master? It doesn’t matter what the role is, I want to see the AWS Practitioner certification on their resume.

I want to know that any co-worker in my organization knows their way around Amazon Web Services. I want them to have a fundamental understanding of the various types of cloud based services that are available to them. 

Anyone I hire needs to know how to provision cloud based resources, make sure those resources are provisioned securely, and make sure the cost of those resources don’t get out of control. If you’re certified as an AWS Practitioner, I know that you know these things.

==== Amazon’s Entry Level Certification Exam

There are currently eleven AWS certification exams in existence, all of which are categorized into as either a professional, specialty, associate or foundational designation.

The fact that the AWS Practitioner certification is foundational is exactly why I like it. If everyone on my team has this certification, I know that we all share a common baseline of understanding when it comes to the technology that underpins most modern enterprise deployments. 

However, for some exam candidates, the foundational designation is a turn-off. People who think like that aren’t thinking clearly.

I often hear from aspiring tech professionals who want to be SysAdmins and feel the Cloud Practitioner exam is a waste of their time, and they want to jump right into the AWS Solutions Architect or Devops Engineer exam stream. I appreciate that level of enthusiasm. I also think it’s wrong-headed.

==== Build a Better Resume

Do you know what looks better than one AWS certification on a resume? Two.

If you want to get the AWS Solutions Architect, DevOps Engineer or even the Machine Learning cert, then go for it. But get the AWS Practitioner exam first. There are compelling reasons why you should do so:

* Two AWS certification are better than one
* Getting the practitioner cert first shows progression
* You’ll develop test taking skills, which will help you pass other exams
* There are key topics only the AWS Practitioner exam covers
* You present yourself as a more, well-rounded AWS professional

Point number four surprises some people, but it’s true. There are topics the AWS Practitioner exam covers, especially with regards to cost management, security and high-level design that isn’t covered in any of the other exams. 

Which means if you jump right into a specialty exam like Advanced Networking or Data Analytics, you’re not as well rounded a job candidate as someone who took the AWS Practitioner Certification first. That puts you at a disadvantage in the competitive career landscape.

And finally, one of the most compelling reasons to get the AWS Practitioner Certification is it’s probably the easiest one to get.
Notice that I didn’t say the AWS Practitioner Certification exam is easy. It’s not. It’s actually pretty hard. It actually covers a wider array of topics than any of the other certification exams, so you need to know a little bit about a lot of things in order to ace it.

==== Early AWS Victories
 
But let’s be honest. The AWS Practitioner Exam is not nearly as intimidating as the AWS Security or Machine Learning exams. You need some very deep knowledge of a very narrow set of technologies in order to pass those exams, and it takes time to curate that amount of specialized knowledge. 

The practitioner exam? Its coverage is broad, but it never goes so esoterically deep that normal human beings couldn’t understand it. The networking and machine language people? They’re not normal human beings.

NOTE: I always find this to be great career motivation: Create a fictitious resume with all the certifications and job experience you wish to have one day. Use it as a vision board and something to strive for. It’s easier to hit a target when you can see it.
