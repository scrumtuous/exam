==== DJ Scrumtuous' Data Dilemma

DJ Scrumtuous is an up and coming rapper who rhymes about DevOps, Scrum and Agile virtues.

She is doing daily video podcasts, recording several new beats a day and taking lots of photographs to document her journey. Unfortunately, she has shot so much video and recorded so many beats, she has no more storage space on her laptop.

DJ Scrumtuous needs 2TB of storage space right now. She also predicts that in six months to a year she will need about 30TB of storage.

She priced out a network storage device (NAS) on Canada Computers and found the cheapest one was $459.

For 30 TB of data, she would need two 16 TB hard drives which are $599 each.

To guard against losing all of her work from a single hard drive failure, she would need an additional two hard drives to 'mirror' the primary hard drives.

DevOps rap is a cutthroat game, so there is a good chance someone will try to steal the hard drives with all of her beats on them. So DJ Scrumtuous also wants to maintain an offsite copy of her data at her Mom's place just in case her apartment gets robbed. So in total, she'd need six 16 TB hard drives.

Oh, and there's one other problem, DJ Scrumtuous knows all about the Thug Life, but she knows nothing about the Nerd Life. She has no idea how to set up a NAS system, so she'd have to hire someone technical to set the whole thing up for her.

==== Amazon S3 Storage

Alternatively, DJ Scrumtuous has learned that 2TB of object storage on Amazon S3 is $47 a month, it's pay-as-you go, and she can increase her storage capacity way beyond 30TB if the need arises.

Furthermore, all S3 data is failover protected, there is 99.95% up-time promise and eleven nines of durability, which means none of her files will ever be lost.

Furthermore, S3 is a fully managed system, so DJ Scrumtuous doesn't have to install anything, manage any software or perform any future upgrades or updates.

Which option do you think DJ Scrumtuous should chose? The $4,321 on-premise solution, or the pay-as-you-go solution that takes advantage of cloud computing

How is over-provisioning or under-provisioning a danger with the on-premise option?

==== A Perspective on Data Sizes

Here's a comparison of the different data size categorizations from a bit, right up to a terrabyte.

* A bit is a piece of data that can be represented by a 1 or a 0.

* A byte is 8 bits of data. Each letter in a text file is a byte of data.

* A kilobyte (KB) is 1000 bytes of data. That's like a text file with 250 words in it.

* A megabyte (MB) is 1000 kilobytes. A 1 minute mp3 is about a mega-byte in size.

* A gigabyte (GB) is 1000 megabytes, or about 17 hours of mp3 music.

* A terrabyte (TB) is 1000 gigabytes, or about 2 years of mp3 music, is a terra-byte (TB)

* A petabyte (PB) is 1000 terabytes. A 4K movie shot in the uncompressed format Hollywood studios use consumes 18.2GB per minute, or just over a single TB per hour. A single movie shoots about 250 hours of footage before editing, all of which can easily approach a petabyte in size.

To personalize these numbers a bit, modern desktop computers sold at big box stores are usually equipped with one or two terrabytes of hard drive space and 8 to 16 gigabytes of memory.
