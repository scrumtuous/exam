=== What is the cloud?

The term 'cloud' is simply a marketing term companies use to make their online products and services sound cool.

Think of all the things you can't do when the Internet goes down:

* You can't watch Netflix
* You can't post to Instagram
* You can't listen to Spotify
* You can't access GMail
* You can't play Fortnite
* You can't chat on Discord

All of these apps, features or services are either entirely cloud based, or at the very least, they require some type of network connectivity to work. You will often hear these products referred to as cloud based services:

* Netflix is a cloud-based movie streaming services
* Facebook is a cloud-based social media platform
* Spotify is a cloud-based music streaming service

With a cloud based application, most of the important logic, storage and data processing functions happen on computers and server your device connects to through the Internet. The data storage and processing does not happen locally on your phone, tablet or computer.

==== The Opposite of the Cloud

Turn off your computer's Internet connection. What programs work?

* You can probably play the built in Solitaire and Minesweeper games.
* If your computer has  Microsoft Office installed, you can probably open up Word and PowerPoint.
* You can play any mp3 files you downloaded to your computer before the Internet went downloaded
* You can view any photos that you previously downloaded off your phone
* You can edit your videos using software like MovieMaker if you have it installed on your machine

None of these examples require the services of externally located computers. All of the data, software and processing power required to play a song or edit a video happens on the tablet you're holding in your hand or on the desktop located in your home.

==== On-Premise vs the Cloud
 
When all of your computing needs are fulfilled by a computer you own, that resided in your house, and it can run without the need to connect to a server located somewhere on the internet, it is referred to as an on-premise system.

Running software programs locally, on an on-premise computer in your home or office without the need for a network connection is the polar opposite of a cloud-based system.

==== What is Cloud Computing?

What does a typical, on-premise desktop or laptop computer do?

* It stores files such as images, videos and music
* It runs programs like PhotoShop, Movie Maker or VirtualDJ Pro

Any time you use a cloud based computer to perform a function that would traditionally be done on a home computer of your own, that's considered cloud-computing.

In its simplest form, storing images, music, videos and other files in Dropbox or in Apple's iCloud can be considered cloud-computing.

When you upload your images and videos Apple's iCloud, instead of downloading them all to your local desktop, you have transferred the responsibility of storing data from your personal device to the cloud.

And when you sort your images by date, or organize your videos by filesize, all of the computer processing required to perform those tasks will be done by iCloud servers, not your phone or your desktop. Not only will your computer have more hard drive space, because all of the data is stored in the cloud, but your computer will likely perform faster because it isn't bogged down by as it tries to manage, index and organize a bloated hard drive.

When you use the cloud to do something a computer would normally do, especially in terms of file storage or data processing, that is what we call cloud-computing.

==== SaaS, PaaS and IaaS

Companies that compete in the cloud computing space can be broken down into three categories: SaaS, PaaS and IaaS.

Companies such as Spotify, Zoom, Uber and WhatsApp are said to be delivering a specialized type of software as a service (SaaS) in the cloud. SaaS providers generally provided highly polished apps that serve a very specific function, like helping you hail a cab or write a email to a friend. 

When we talk about cloud computing vendors, we're not usually talking about SaaS providers that deliver a highly piece of polished software in the cloud. Instead, we typically think of companies such as Amazon and their Amazon Web Services platform which provides us platforms in the cloud where we can deploy applications, or even just provide us access to underlying cloud based infrastructure. 

When we talk about cloud computing, we're normally talking about companies who offer Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) based solutions.

.Saas PaaS IaaS are the three main types of cloud service offerings

==== Cloud Computing Vendors

Amazon is the biggest and the best known provider of Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offerings, but they certainly aren't the only vendor in the market. The other big cloud computing vendors who offer a similar set of services to Amazon include:

* The Google Cloud Platform (GCP) which has $20 billion in annual sales

* Microsoft's Azure Platform which has about $70 billion in annual sales

* China's Alibaba cloud which has just under $10 billion in annual sales

* The IBM Cloud with its various Watson offerings

* The Oracle Cloud

==== Vendor Differentiation

All of these companies try to differentiate themselves on price, products and customer service, but the fact is, they all provide the same core set of services, many of which are completely interchangeable, at similar prices.

One of the key differences between a cloud computing vendor and other companies that have cloud based offerings, is that the services provided by the cloud computing vendors are intended to be used by other companies to build their SaaS offerings.

The various Amazon services are like jigsaw puzzle pieces other companies can use to build their own products. It should come as a surprise to nobody to find out that when Amazon Web Services go.

There are many contenders in the world of cloud computing, but from here on in, our focus will be Amazon
