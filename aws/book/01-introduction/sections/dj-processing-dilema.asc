==== DJ Scrumtuous' Processing Problem

Every night DJ Scrumtuous processes the raw, 4K video she shoots on her daily, long-form podcast. However, her laptop simply isn't powerful enough.

It usually takes 4 hours to process one hour of video on her laptop, so a 3 hour video has to process overnight. Furthermore, sometimes her laptop runs out of memory and when she wakes up in the morning, the process has failed to complete.

Other times she has three separate video files that need to process. That means she sometimes has to get up in the middle of the night to start a second or third file to process in order to make her videos available to her fans the next day.

To reduce the processing time and eliminate system crashes, DJ Scrumtuous has priced out a system with 64 gigs of memory and an i9-11900K processor for $6,099 plus tax. The up and coming DJ doesn't have that much money on hand, but has been offered financing with a 22% interest rate. Her monthly payments will be $270 for 3 years.

Optionally, DJ Scrumtuous have found out that she can install her video editing software on a virtual Windows machine that runs on Amazon's Elastic Cloud Computing (EC2) service.

The EC2 cloud service allows the video processing to run on extremely powerful servers that will compress an hour of video in about 45 minutes. Furthermore, if there are multiple videos to process, three separate virtual machines can be run in parallel, allowing all three files to be processed at the same time - something that wouldn't be possible on the on-premise machine she is thinking of purchasing.

Each hour of video processed on Amazon EC2 instances would cost $2. DJ Scrumptuous expects to process about 150 hours of video a month, so her monthly cost would be $300.

Which option do you think would be the best for DJ Scrumtuous, the $6,099 on-premise solution, or the solution that takes advantage of virtual machines and cloud computing?
