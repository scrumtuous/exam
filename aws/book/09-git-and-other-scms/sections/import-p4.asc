[[_perforce_import]]
==== Perforce

(((Perforce)))(((Importing, from Perforce)))
The next system you'll look at importing from is Perforce.
As we discussed above, there are two ways to let Git and Perforce talk to each other: git-p4 and Perforce Git Fusion.

===== Perforce Git Fusion

Git Fusion makes this process fairly painless.
Just configure your project settings, user mappings, and branches using a configuration file (as discussed in <<_p4_git_fusion>>), and clone the repository.
Git Fusion leaves you with what looks like a native Git repository, which is then ready to push to a native Git host if you desire.
You could even use Perforce as your Git host if you like.

[[_git_p4]]
===== Git-p4

Git-p4 can also act as an import tool.
As an example, we'll import the Jam project from the Perforce Public Depot.
To set up your client, you must export the P4PORT environment variable to point to the Perforce depot:

[source,console]
----
$ export P4PORT=public.perforce.com:1666
----

[NOTE]
====
In order to follow along, you'll need a Perforce depot to connect with.
We'll be using the public depot at public.perforce.com for our examples, but you can use any depot you have access to.
====

(((git commands, p4)))
Run the `git p4 clone` command to import the Jam project from the Perforce server, supplying the depot and project path and the path into which you want to import the project:

[source,console]
----
$ git-p4 clone //guest/perforce_software/jam@all p4import
Importing from //guest/perforce_software/jam@all into p4import
Initialized empty Git repository in /private/tmp/p4import/.git/
Import destination: refs/remotes/p4/master
Importing revision 9957 (100%)
----

This particular project has only one branch, but if you have branches that are configured with branch views (or just a set of directories), you can use the `--detect-branches` flag to `git p4 clone` to import all the project's branches as well.
See <<_git_p4_branches>> for a bit more detail on this.

At this point you're almost done.
If you go to the `p4import` directory and run `git log`, you can see your imported work:

[source,console]
----
$ git log -2

You can see that `git-p4` has left an identifier in each commit message.
It's fine to keep that identifier there, in case you need to reference the Perforce change number later.
However, if you'd like to remove the identifier, now is the time to do so â€“ before you start doing work on the new repository.
(((git commands, filter-branch)))
You can use `git filter-branch` to remove the identifier strings en masse:

[source,console]
----
$ git filter-branch --msg-filter 'sed -e "/^\[git-p4:/d"'
Rewrite e5da1c909e5db3036475419f6379f2c73710c4e6 (125/125)
Ref 'refs/heads/master' was rewritten
----

If you run `git log`, you can see that all the SHA-1 checksums for the commits have changed, but the `git-p4` strings are no longer in the commit messages:

[source,console]
----
$ git log -2
