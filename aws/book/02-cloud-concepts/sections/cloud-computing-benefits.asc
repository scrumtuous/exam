== Cloud Computing Benefits

Organizations that have successfully used on-premise data centers for
decades are sometimes reluctant to move their operations to the cloud.

And sometimes new companies and start-ups want to buy a big and
expensive server of their own so they can be in full control of their
infrastructure.

But regardless of their best instincts, any organization that requires
some type of compute capacity should be aware of the benefits cloud
computing could bring. And as an AWS Certified Practitioner, you will be
expected to speak intelligently about the benefits of cloud computing
over the use of traditional on premise data centers.

Amazon wants you to be able to guilt people about what they’re missing
out on if they chose an on premise solution over their cloud based
solutions.

The ten benefits of cloud computing an AWS Practitioner is required to
know in order to pass the certification exam include:

. High Availability
. Reliability
. Scalability and Capacity
. Elasticity
. Cost Savings
. Global Reach
. Agility (preconfigured)
. Pre-Certified Compliance
. Enhanced Security
. Sustainability through Economies of Scale
. Availability

Unless you work for Google, it’s unlikely that your company could build
an IT infrastructure that is more highly available than AWS.

Amazon services rarely go down. And what little downtime AWS services do
have are typically counted in seconds, not minutes or hours.

For multi-availability zone (AZ) deployments of compute services such as
EC2, EBS, ECS and EKS, the Amazon SLA promises 99.99% uptime.That's less
than 250 seconds of downtime in a month.

It's unlikely that you'd be able to achieve availability like that with
a system that you built yourself, and even if you could, the cost would
likely be immense.

More secure - certified as PCI-DSS, HIPAA/HITECH, FedRAMP, GDPR, FIPS
140-2, and NIST 800-171 already.What would it take to certify that
server you just bought?

=== Reliability

Availability speaks to how long a service is up and running. Reliability
speaks to how well a service performs the tasks it promises to do. After
all, what good is a highly-available database if it randomly loses
records?

Amazon will constantly upgrade, update, patch and test their systems to
make sure they perform as promised. And they guarantee their reliability
at an incredible rate.

For example, S3 Glacier Deep Archive is designed to provide ‘eleven
nines’ of reliability. That’s a 99.999999999% promise.

To put that into perspective, if you store ten million objects in S3
Glacier, it’d be 10,000 years before you lost even one persisted object.

=== Availability

More highly available- very little down time

AWS will use commercially reasonable efforts to make each Included
Service available for each AWS region with a Monthly Uptime Percentage
of at least 99.99%. And if they fail to achieve that, you get service
credits.

That's less than 250 seconds in a month. It's unlikely that you'd be
able to achieve that with your own on-prem systems.

140-2, and NIST 800-171 already.What would it take to certify that
server you just bought?

=== Scalability

What happens with an on-premise solution when demand outstrips capacity?

To scale an on-premise data center you need to buy more servers, install
more CPUs, add memory to existing systems, upgrade the network trunk and
hope your added infrastructure keeps pace with demand. It’s costly, time
consuming and slow. After all, it can take months to purchase and bring
a new server online.

In the cloud, you can scale with the click of a button.

Need more processing power? Then just add more virtual CPUs to your EC2
instances. The same holds true with memory.

Does your Kubernetes cluster need more throughput? You can add new
replica sets in just a few clicks. In the cloud, you can scale your
architecture in minutes.

Cloud based architectures scale much easier than an on-premise data
center.

===  Elasticity

Scalability describes how a system can add capacity to deal with
increasing demands.

But what happens when you scale up to meet a spike in demand, only to
have the demand trail off? You could easily end up with millions of
dollars of servers and infrastructure just sitting around idle. With
AWS, you can not only scale up, but you can scale down as well.

Elasticity is the idea that you can both scale up and wind down your
infrastructure. No longer does capacity planning become an issue with
your compute resources.

All AWS components have programmable interfaces that allow developers to
query them and automate their provisioning so that your organization is
always guaranteed a ‘right-size’ infrastructure.

For EC2, ECS, DynamoDB and Amazon Aurora replicas, Amazon provides the
AWS Auto Scaling tool which automatically scales your resources to
optimize costs, availability or a combination of both.

It’s impossible to ‘right-size’ on premise infrastructure because
workloads change from day to day and month to month. But with AWS, all
you need to do is turn on AWS Auto Scaling and your compute resources
will right size themselves automatically.

===  Cost Savings

The economics of cloud computing is all about cost savings.

In the cloud, capacity planning is no longer guess work. You simply
scale up and down when needed. You don’t have to spend millions of
dollars up front to for software licenses or expensive servers. And
you’ll never run into the problem of where you’ve provisioned too much.
With auto-scaling, you always have a ‘right sized’ environment.

This translates into significant costs savings. In the cloud, you pay
only for what you use. And due to the cost efficiencies that come with
Amazon’s economics of scale, cloud computing costs are often lower than
what you could achieve by running an on premise data center of your own.

The pay as you go pricing model, the fact that you only pay for what you
use, and the fact that cloud based resources are often cheaper than
anything you could build yourself can translate into significant cost
savings for organizations.

=== Global Reach

More global than anything you could build yourself.

AWS has data centers on every continent except one, with reliable,
high-speed network connectivity between all of them.

With AWS, you have the ability to deploy applications into the AWS
region that best fits your customer's needs. And you can further
leverage Edge Locations around the world that have the power to cache
data and further reduce application latency.

Achieving this type of global reach on your own would be incredibly
difficult and prohibitively expensive. But it's available from AWS right
from the start. And due to the efficiencies that come with Amazon’s
economy of scale, taking advantage of Amazon’s global reach is
relatively inexpensive.

===  Agility

In the past, when a DEV team needed a test machine or a continuous
integration server, they’d have to go through the process of filling out
requisition forms, waiting for the hardware, figure out how to install
the software they need and the maintain the application throughout the
lifecycle of the project.

In the cloud, a DEV team can spin up an EC2 instance preconfigured with
Apache Tomcat or a Jenkins CI/CD server with the click of a button. That
makes teams more agile.

Furthermore, when managed services like RDS, ECS, EKS and DynamoDB are
used, the software comes pre-configured and is fully maintained by
Amazon. Nobody on the DEV team needs to develop special skills to
maintain the software. That allows teams to shift to revenue-generating
activities as opposed to managing infrastructure.

===  Pre-Certified Compliance

Obtaining compliance certification, be it for security, privacy or
industry based regulations, is an onerous exercise. However, AWS comes
pre-certified in a multitude of fields, including:

* Health care (HIPPA)
* Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS)
* Privacy (PIPEDA and FERPA)
* International Standards Organization Certifications (ISO)
* System and Organization Controls (SOC) compliance


Amazon maintains a long list of the compliance certifications they have
achieved on their AWS Compliance Programs page. If your industry’s
standards are listed as being pre-certified by AWS, you can confidently
run your applications on Amazon’s infrastructure knowing you are not out
of compliance.

The AWS Compliance Programs page breaks down the various ways their
cloud-based services are certified and attested to in four different
fields:

[arabic]
. Laws
. Regulations
. Privacy
. Alignments and Frameworks

These industry certifications are further broken down into the following
geographic areas:

. Global
. Americas
. Asia Pacific
. Europe, Middle East and Africa

When you move to the cloud, you will deploy onto hardware and software
that has been more rigorously certified than any on-premise architecture
you could build on your own.

==== Shared Responsibility Model

It’s worth noting that security and compliance is a two-way street. AWS
can provide infrastructure that meets the strictest requirements and
standards, but your organization has to know the local regulatory rules
that apply to your customers, industry and country.

For example, the province of Quebec in Canada does not allow any
personal information to be processed outside the province. No matter how
compliant AWS software is, if you push personal data of a Quebec citizen
onto an EC2 instance running in Europe, you will have violated Quebec’s
Privacy Act. That’s your responsibility, not Amazon’s.

=== Enhanced Security

Some detractors suggest moving their data and applications into the
cloud would create a security risk, but nothing could be further from
the truth.

All data that flows across the AWS global network is automatically
encrypted. And most AWS services, such as AWS S3, provide the option to
encrypt all data at rest so that if a data storage device was ever
compromised, the information on it would be indecipherable.

Furthermore, Amazon provides a number of built in tools such as AWS
Config, which monitor for security non-compliance. AWS Config is an
Amazon service that will assess, audit and evaluate configurations
against a list of pre-configured and customizable rules. If a
configuration is ever made that violates your security rules, AWS Config
will flag the resource as non-compliant.

Furthermore, Amazon client’s also enjoy the use of Amazon CloudTrail, a
technology that will log every configuration change made in your
account, along with the identity of the user that made the change. That
way if your system ever does go out of security compliance, there is a
trail that will lead you to who made the change and all the other
configuration changes that user made leading up to it.

Built-in encryption options, mandated encryption between data centers
and the various tools that help you track user change and identify
non-compliant configurations are not available ‘out-of-the-box’ in on
premise data centers, but they are ready on day one when you use the AWS
cloud.

== Environmental Sustainability

It takes a significant amount of resources to power a data center.

Land, human resources, water, energy and most importantly, human
resources, are all required to keep a data-center running.

When a single company like Amazon builds a massive data center, the
economies of scale create efficiencies and eliminate waste in ways that
simply can’t be achieved on a smaller scale.

“Organizations generally use 77% fewer servers, 84% less power, and tap
into a 28% cleaner mix of solar and wind power in the AWS Cloud versus
their own data centers.”

There would be a considerably smaller impact on the environment if
enterprises moved all of their infrastructure into the cloud, as opposed
to each one running an inefficient data center of their own.

As you can see, there are very compelling reasons to use AWS in the
cloud. But as compelling as they are, the decision to move to an
on-premise data center into the cloud usually boils down to one thing:
cost savings. Which is why a significant portion of the AWS Practitioner
exam is dedicated to the economics of cloud computing.

You can talk to a CTO about the benefits of AWS all day long, but if the
economics of cloud computing don’t make sense, the on-premise
data-center isn’t going anywhere.

A certified AWS Practitioner is expected to be able to articulate to
anyone why the economics of cloud computing simply makes sense.
