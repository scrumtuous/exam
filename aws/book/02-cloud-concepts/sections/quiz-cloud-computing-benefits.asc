- [ ] High availability
- [ ] Elasticity
- [*] Global reach
- [ ] An economy of scale

[answer]
The ability to reduce latency times through the use of CloudFront's CDN network is an example of Amazon's global reach.

Question 2: Amazon can offer low-cost services, below the costs of even very large corporate enterprises, due to their ability to leverage: (Choose 1)

- [ ] Security
- [ ] Elasticity
- [ ] Agility
- [x] An economy of scale

[answer]
For many businesses, per-unit operating costs gets small and smaller as an organization gets bigger and more specialized. For example, a farmer can be more productive concentrating on one crop, rather than planting five or six. 

Amazon, due to their vast global infrastructure and specialty in the delivery of IT services can achieve significant economies of scale, and can thus delivery infrastructure as a service at costs that are much lower than if an organization attempted their own, on-premise implementation.

Question 3: A startup that uses the AWS cloud for all of their infrastructure and service needs experiences which benefit: (Choose 2)

- [*] The ability to focus more efforts on product development
- [*] The ability to focus more efforts on revenue generating activities
- [ ] The ability to gain skills in managing hardware
- [ ] The elimination of the need to monitor costs

[answer]
The use of the AWS cloud allows users to focus on business value and not having to deal with infrastructure tasks such as managing servers, upgrading processors or adding a new hard drive to a compute. As a result, businesses can focus on creative tasks, product development and hopefully revenue generation. 

Use of the cloud will not enhance an organizations understanding of hardware or infrastructure. And even though the cloud is being used, costs must still be monitored. Operating in the cloud can indeed get expensive.

- [*] Elasticity
- [ ] Scalability
- [ ] Agility
- [ ] Reliability

[answer]
The ability to scale up and to scale down is known as elasticity. The ability to write programs that can automate the allocation and deallocation of resources makes cloud computing a very appealing option for organizations with unpredictable loads.

- [ ] Available
- [ ] Elastic
- [ ] Reliable
- [*] Scalable

[answer]
The ability of a system to handling increased workloads without any degradation in performance is known as it's scalability.

- [*] Highly available
- [ ] Elastic
- [ ] Reliable
- [ ] Scalable

[answer]
When a system can recover from subsystem failures, outages in certain data centers, or even remain working when natural disasters strike, it is said to be highly available.

Question 7: Data stored in the 'durable storage' class of Amazon S3 is said to have eleven 9's. That is, 99.999999999% durability. This is an example of Amazon's ability to delivery impeccable: (Choose 1)

- [ ] Availability
- [ ] Elasticity
- [*] Reliability
- [ ] Scalability

[answer]
"If you store 10,000 objects in S3, you may lose on every 10 million years or so." That is how reliable S3 storage is.

Note that reliability is different from availability. Availability is an indication of how accessible an object is. The data in S3 may be stored durably, but that doesn't mean the service may go offline from time to time and your objects, while stored reliably, might not be available for a moment or two.

Question 8: An organization that runs their infrastructure in the cloud: (Choose 2)

- [*] Will have more time to differentiate their product from their competitors
- [ ] Will have increased hardware costs
- [ ] Will have increased utility costs
- [*] Will have more resources to focus on customers

[answer]
From the Six Advantages of Cloud Computing: Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers – Focus on projects that differentiate your business, not the infrastructure. Cloud computing lets you focus on your own customers, rather than on the heavy lifting of racking, stacking, and powering servers.

Question 9: Expensive mistakes made purchasing hardware to meet the capacity of unpredictable workloads can be eliminated through the use of Amazon's (Choose 2)

- [*] Elasticity
- [ ] Reliability
- [ ] Agility
- [*] Pay-as-you-go pricing model

[answer]
Elasticity provided by AWS allows applications to scale up and and down automatically as workload demands increase and decrease.

By paying only for what you use, organizations can avoid spending millions on hardware and infrastructure expenses that may not be needed if product demand is below expectations.

From the Six Advantages of Cloud Computing: Stop guessing capacity – Eliminate guessing on your infrastructure capacity needs. When you make a capacity decision prior to deploying an application, you often end up either sitting on expensive idle resources or dealing with limited capacity. With cloud computing, these problems go away. You can access as much or as little capacity as you need, and scale up and down as required with only a few minutes’ notice.

Question 10: Amazon's ability to achieve lower variable costs due to their immense size and specialization in IT is known as: (Choose 1)

- [*] An economy of scale
- [ ] Parallel thinking
- [ ]The benefit of monolithic architecture
- [ ]Component decoupling

[answer]
When an organization achieves incredibly low variable costs through expansion and specialization, it is known as an economy of scale.

From the Six Advantages of Cloud Computing: Benefit from massive economies of scale – By using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower variable cost than you can get on your own. Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers is aggregated in the cloud, providers such as AWS can achieve higher economies of scale, which translates into lower pay as-you-go prices.
