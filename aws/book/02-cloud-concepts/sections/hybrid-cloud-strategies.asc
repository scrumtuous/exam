=== Hybrid Cloud Strategies

There are many compelling reasons for an organization to move to the
cloud. But at the same time, there are many, often pragmatic reasons,
why organizations must maintain a local data center. Fortunately, the
movement to the cloud doesn’t have to be an all or nothing thing.

Most digital transformations happen incrementally. Some parts of an
organization's compute requirements are moved into the cloud, while
others remain on premises.

Organizations usually transition from on premise to a hybrid cloud
configuration by following the following hybrid cloud strategies.

. Object Storage First
. Greenfield to the Cloud
. Virtual Machine Replatforming
. Cloudbursting
. Cloud native refactoring


==== Object Storage First

The cloud offers low cost and highly reliable storage options for
images, text data, archival backups. This type of object storage can be
moved to the cloud with a minimal risk of disturbing live applications,
and there are typically large cost savings compared to on-site archival
strategies.

Moving object storage to cloud is not only a good strategy, it also
helps the IT team get a big win under their belt as the company begins
its digital transformation.

NOTE: The Simple Storage Service (S3) is a low-cost, object storage solution from Amazon.

==== Greenfield to the Cloud

An organization might not want to move existing applications to the
cloud, but why not create a rule that says all new applications must
take a cloud-first approach. As a company builds more new applications,
their cloud based presence will slowly increase.

This type of approach also helps DevOps teams slowly adapt to the change
from on-premise development to direct deployment to the cloud.

NOTE: The term _greenfield_ refers to brand new applications built from scratch. In contrast, a _brownfield_ app is one that has been in production for a while and is being updated.

==== Virtual Machine Replatforming

In the early 2000s virtual machines uprooted the IT landscape. IT
departments across the country learned they could support multiple
applications on a single computer by deploying each application onto a
separate virtual machine.

The virtual machine deployment model is still widely used in data
centers across the world.

EC2 is simply a cloud based mechanism to host virtual machines. So one
common hybrid cloud strategy is to replatform virtual machines running
in an on-premise data center into the cloud. Just upload your VMware,
Hyper-V or Citrix virtual machines to the cloud and run them as EC2
instances.

NOTE: EC2 stands for Elastic Compute Cloud. It's part of Amazon's Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offering.

This _lift and shift_ strategy in a hybrid cloud environment is often
complicated by the need to connect back to on-premise databases and
directories, but once the connectivity issues are resolved, this is a
very easy way to get complex applications moved out of the on-premise
data center and into the cloud.

==== Cloudbursting

When an on-premise data center needs some extra help to handle peak
loads, a strategy called cloudbursting can be adopted.

Cloudbursting is a peak-load strategy that combines a company’s existing
on-premisis systems with easily scalable cloud-based infrastructure.
When the on-premise infrastructure is overloaded, overflow traffic can
be sent to the cloud.

Cloudbursting can also be used to shift long-running processes that
consume on-premise resources into the cloud. This works especially well
for the processing of large volumes of data that would run slowly on a
single, on-premise virtual machine, but could be chuncked out and run in
parallel on multiple virtual virtual machines.

Big data analytics, sharded databases, read-only web content and machine
learning models are all great candidates for cloud bursting.

According to the AWS documentation, “Cloudbursting is an application
hosting model which combines existing corporate infrastructure with new,
cloud-based infrastructure to create a powerful, highly scalable
application hosting environment.”

==== Cloud native refactoring

It’s easy to put brand new, greenfield projects into the cloud.
Traditional, brownfield projects that already run on existing
infrastructure? That’s not as easy.

Monolithic enterprise applications written ten or fifteen years ago
don’t always migrate cleanly into the could. But it’s not hard to
identify pieces of a monolith that could be decoupled and broken down
into cloud-native microservices. These new microservices can then be
considered greenfield projects and begin their production lifecycle in
the cloud.

INFO: A cloud native application is one that is designed specifically to take advantage of cloud based services and deployment.

Refactoring monolithic applications, breaking them down into more
manageable, decoupled components and then hosting those cloud-native
microservices in the cloud is a popular hybrid cloud strategy
organizations use to push forward their digital transformations.

AWS Outpost - Amazon actually has a product that takes hybrid cloud
computing to the next level. It’s called the AWS Output.

The AWS Outpost is a giant server that you install in your on-premise
data center that provides a variety of AWS services such as S3 and EC2.
The server maintains a high-speed connection back to the AWS data center
in your region
