=== Economics of Cloud Computing

The economics of cloud computing revolves entirely around cost savings.

Usually, economics deals with investments and the financial returns you get on them. But in the world of cloud computing economics, there are no investments to be made. 

Cloud economics revolves around a pay-as-you go model. You don’t have to purchase servers. You don’t have to rent out a data center. You don’t have any up-front licensing costs. 

You simply ‘right-size’ your architecture, scale elastically, and pay a monthly bill to cover the infrastructure you use. There are no investments, and subsequently, there is no ROI.
Factors in Cloud Computing Economics 

The key to the economics of cloud computing is knowing where a company’s cost savings lay. The 10 most common sources of cost savings companies can realize when adopting cloud based technologies include:

. Reduction in traditional CapEx costs
. Reduction in traditional OpEx costs
. Reduced costs to license software
. Reduced salaries for specialized workers
. The automation of previously manual tasks
. Increased developer productivity
. Reduced compliance and regulatory costs
. Elimination of overspending through right-sizing
. Customer retainment
. Low cost course correction

==== 1. Traditional CapEx cost reductions

An IBM mainframe will cost you several hundreds of thousands to buy. Even a well-equipped workstation will cost tens of thousands of dollars. That's a lot of money to dish out up front, especially if you're not 100% sure that your online venture is going to be a total success.

To run an on-premise data-center of your own, there are many, large, up-front capital costs to think about, including:

* land real estate costs
* building costs
* cooling and ventilation systems
* parking and shuttle busses for employees
* mainframes, workstations and laptops

These CapEx costs can easily run into the millions of dollars.

Of course, these costs will be amortized over many years. That's actually the definition of a capital expenditure - it's a physical asset you purchase whose utility will span over multiple years. But they are still an intimidating expense.

With the cloud, you don't have CapEx costs. You get pay-as-you-go pricing and only pay for what you use. 

A big benefit of the cloud economics model is significant cost savings through the elimination of major capital expenditures.



==== 2. Traditional OpEx cost reductions

The move to cloud computing can also significantly reduce and organization's operational expenditures, or OpEx.

Long term investments fall under the CapEx umbrella. Short term, often recurring costs, fall under the term CapEx.

The economics of cloud computing brings with it the promise of reduced OpEx costs as well. For example, closing your on-premise data center and moving to the cloud would eliminate OpEx costs such as:

* salaries for security guards who watch the server room
* property taxes on the data center that must be paid quarterly
* rent paid to a storage facility that holds your data backups
* electricity to power your servers and network routers

The economics of cloud computing allows for significant cost savings in terms of the reduction of operational expenditures. 

==== 3. Reduced licensing costs

Software licenses for operating systems, databases, applications servers and storage systems can run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. 

Furthermore, traditional licenses limit the number of CPUs that can run them. Or they limit the number of users that can access them.

In the cloud, the license cost is built into the resource cost. So if you use an EC2 instance that runs Windows 2020, there is no need to for any up-front license expenditures. The cost of the license is built right into the pay-as-you go pricing model

Furthermore, the agility of the cloud allows organizations to experiment with new servers and technologies. If you really want to experience the cost savings of cloud economics, begin experimenting with open source software and migrate away from licensed software entirely

==== 4. Fewer specialized staff (managed services)

If your company plans to build an on-premise data-center with database servers and Kubernetes clusters, you will need to hire specialized staff who know how to install, patch, update and configure that software. That's an ongoing salary expense that never goes away.

However, cloud computing vendors offer a variety of managed services such as ECS, EKS, RDS and DynamoDB where the installation, updating, patching, configuration and security hardening is already taken care of for you.

There's no need to hire a DB Admin to patch your system, or the need for a SysOps Admin to configure Kubernetes replica sets. With a managed service, ongoing maintenance and management is part of Amazon's responsibility. 

The need to hire employees with specialized software administration skills goes away.

==== 5. Task Automation

Every AWS service that can be provisioned through the management console can be configured through a script or computer program.

That means the human element can be completely removed from your deployment process. 

The human element can be further removed from your resource management processes as well, as the AWS auto scaling tool can manage resource allocation and ensure you only ever pay for the 'right-sized infrastructure' your organization needs.

The ability to automate common tasks not only makes your systems more predictable and reliable, but they can reduce costs as salaried workers are no longer needed to perform automated tasks.


==== 6. Increased developer productivity

Cloud based services provide developers a level of Agility that on-premise data-centers simply can't parallel.

From the quick provisioning of an Aurora database instance, or the ability to test a Java web application with the Elastic Beanstalk, programming becomes less tedious, and developers become more productive.

That results in less overtime hours and a faster time to market, all of which reduce costs for your organization.


==== 7. Reduced compliance scope and overhead

Imagine a compliance officer came into your office and asked for a list of every configuration change made to your environment over the past 6 months.

These types of requests are not uncommon in highly regulated industries such as health care and banking. But very few systems provide this type of detailed access history out of the box.

To remain compliant, your organization would need to either build a system that tracks and saves every configuration change you make, or purchase a third party product. But with built-in tools such AWS CloudTrail or Amazon CloudWatch, staying compliant isn't a concern. And the functionality is built right into the tools, so there is no additional cost to track configuration changes or the activity of your organization's users.


==== 8. Provide a 'right-sized' infrastructure

The rule of thumb in on-premise architecture is to build an infrastructure that only uses 50% of your capacity while under your highest sustained load of the year. This is an absolute requirement to support failover if something goes wrong.  

So even on your busiest day, 50% of your processing capacity sits idle. In non-peak hours, that could be as high as 95%. That's a lot of wasted infrastructure.

The economics of cloud computing eliminates that waste by always providing 'right-sized' infrastructure for your applications. 

Applications can be deployed into compute clouds with minimal resources dedicated to them, and automation tools can be configured to add computing power as needed. Elastic load balancers can then take those additional resources offline as traffic dies down.

Elastic, pay-as-you-go, 'right-sized' architectures eliminate the need to overprovision. It's just one more way the economics of cloud computing can help your company save money.

==== 9. Customer retainments

Cloud based systems are highly available, with guaranteed up-times very few companies could achieve without incurring a significant cost. For example, Amazon EC2 instances are guaranteed to be available 99.99% uptime. That's less than an hour of downtime over the entire course of a year.

Similarly, cloud based systems are incredibly reliable. For example, Amazon's S3 data storage service promises 99.999999999% durability. "If you store 10,000 objects with us, on average we may lose one of them every 10 million years or so."

Systems that are available and reliable help to retain customers. There will be no more downtime due to problems with your on premise data-center. That means a financial savings by eliminating lost sales.


==== 10. Back out of costly mistakes

Projects often fail, and changes to the existing architecture don't always work out. The pay-as-you-go model that is central to the economics of cloud computing allows companies to quickly back out of bad decisions without incurring any long term costs, be it for the initial provisioning of hardware, or for the up-front purchasing of software licenses.

The cloud allows developers and architects to experiment, test their assumptions and try new deployment strategies with very little up-front costs. If things don't go as planned, companies can back away from any bad decisions without the incursion of any long-term costs.

The economics of cloud computing is all about identifying the various ways a company can save money as they forgo the management and maintenance of an on-premise data center. For most organizations, the economics of cloud computing makes sense, as the calculated cost savings are significant.
