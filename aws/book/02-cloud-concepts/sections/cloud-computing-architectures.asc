=== Cloud Computing Architectures

Amazon’s goal for the AWS Practitioner exam is not simply to certify
individuals who can prove their knowledge of cloud computing.

Amazon’s goal for the Practitioner exam is to create an army of AWS
advocates who will preach the virtues of cloud computing every time the
opportunity arises.

Amazon wants every compute operation to happen their cloud, and they
want you, as an AWS Practitioner, to help them achieve that end.

There are three types of cloud computing models:

. Full cloud
. Hybrid cloud (Some cloud, some on premise servers)
. On Premise (No cloud)

Obviously, Amazon wants AWS practitioners to advocate for full cloud
deployments.

For those not willing to go whole-hog into the cloud, Amazon wants AWS
practitioners to push for a combination of on premise operations and
cloud computing technology. That’s known as a hybrid model.

In an on-premise operation, the cloud is not used at all. Obviously
that’s not a result Amazon is interested in. As far as an AWS
Practitioner is concerned, there are only a few scenarios in which
on-premise data center may be justified.

.Many organizations both use the cloud and maintain on-premise servers in what is known as a hybrid cloud.

==== Why stay on-prem?

The fact is, not every organization is ready to move to the cloud.
Pragmatically speaking, some might not even need to.

Many organizations built giant server-farms and data centers long before
AWS became a thing, and those on-premise data centers continue to
fulfill the data-processing needs of those companies. If those data
centers are already paid for and operate at peak efficiency, the
disruption associated with shifting all of their operations to the cloud
won’t be worth it.

There are other reasons why organizations like to maintain their own
data processing centers. Here are the most common reasons why
organizations choose to process data on-prem, rather than in the cloud:

* Super low-latency requirements

* Data transfer excessive

* Data sovereignty rules and regulations

* Network isolation requirements

* FUD


==== Low Latency Computing

For applications that need ultra-fast response times in the single
millisecond mark, you need to be ‘close to the metal.’ That means
eliminating the layers of abstraction that comes along with virtual
machines, Docker containers and software that uses hypervisors that
abstract away the CPU from the software.

Voice networks, high-frequency stock trading and some video game
providers will often run applications with extremely low latency
requirements.

==== Excessive Data Transfers

Most cloud providers charge a premium to move data in and out of their
data-centers. If your application is architected in such a way where
hundreds of Gigs of data need to be moved back and forth between the
cloud and your clients, a cloud based solution, the economics of the
cloud might not make sense.

==== Data sovereignty Rules and Regulations

Some countries have rules about where data can be processed.

In Quebec, privacy laws state that personally identifiable data can not
be exported outside the province’s borders. Processing, storing or even
moving data into a AWS service running in Europe or Africa would be a
clear violation of the law.

Similarly, there are often tax requirements or industry regulations that
forbid certain pieces of data and computations to be performed outside
the physical walls of an organization. In these situations, an
on-premise solution must be used.

Note: Amazon recently put an availability zone in Canada. It’s located
in Montreal so it can be used by Quebec based clients without violating
privacy laws.

==== Network Isolation Requirements

Some applications simply can’t be connected to an external network in
any way, shape or form.

The computers that run Iran’s nuclear programs followed this rule. The
system was so important that they would not take any risks with it, so
no network connections were allowed.

The Israeles still managed to get a USB drive in there to screw up all
the centrifuges, but the point remains the same. Sometimes there are
applications that simply cannot be connected to an external network,
ever.

.Top secret government operations like enriching weapons grade uranium will often be completely isolated from any networks including the cloud.

==== FUD

Sometimes an organization is simply so steeped in fear, uncertainty and
doubt (FUD), that they refuse to move to the cloud, even if the capacity
for cost savings and improved reliability are clear.

Sometimes clients require extra convincing when it comes to making the
move from their on premise data center to a cloud computing solution
like AWS. That’s why the AWS Practitioner exam wants every successful
candidate to be able to preach the benefits of cloud computing to any
decision maker who has doubts about the technology.
